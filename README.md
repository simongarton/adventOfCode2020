# Advent Of Code 2020

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) : a yearly programming competition.

## Day 9
Given a stream of numbers, find the first one that isn't the sum of a pair within the previous 25;
then the sum of some other numbers determined by that value. Straightforward.

## Day 8 
Build a little 3 instruction processor, debug a program to find the infinite loop
and then figure out which instruction is wrong to allow it to terminate. Nice.

## Day 7 
Recursive objects, bags holding bags. Nice.

## Day 6 
Set manipulation. Disappointingly easy.

## Day 5 
You're given a string of chars that identifies a specific seat on a
plan using binary space partitioning; decode each string e.g.
FBFBBFFRLR to work out which row and column you are in. Then from 
the list, find the missing entry.

## Day 4 
Parse a list of strings which have key-value pairs to make up
'passports' and find out with validation rules which are valid or not. e.g.

```'''  
ecl:gry pid:860033327 eyr:2020 hcl:#fffffd
byr:1937 iyr:2017 cid:147 hgt:183cm
```

## Day 3
Definitely cute : a map of a hillside with trees, given a certain
angle to ride the toboggan down, how many trees do you hit ? The trees
repeat in patterns out to the right.

```
O.##.......
#.O.#...#..
.#..X.#..#.
..#.#.O.#.#
.#...##.O#.
```

## Day 2 
Parse strings to find out which follow specified rules.

## Day 1
A list of 200 numbers, first part is to find a combination of 2 that adds up to 2020
and then multiply them together; second part was same thing but for 3 numbers.
