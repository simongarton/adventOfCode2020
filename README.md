# Advent Of Code 2020

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) : a yearly programming competition.

## Day 0 
An empty task just to set up environment.

## Day 1
A list of 200 numbers, first part is to find a combination of 2 that adds up to 2020
and then multiply them together; second part was same thing but for 3 numbers.
Tried the first with a list and a set, neither took more than 1 ms.
Tried the second with a list, no problems.
