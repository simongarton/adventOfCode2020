# Advent Of Code 2020

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) : a yearly programming competition.

## Day 14 Docking Data
Build a binary processor that works with values and applies masks.

## Day 13 Shuttle Search
Periods and cycles. Part 1 straight forward, part 2 needs a clever solution. The
subreddit suggested Chinese Remainder Theorem, but my maths isn't up to it. However,
other examples suggested periodicity, and I translated an algorithm which then made sense.

## Day 12 Rain Risk
Straightforward example of moving a ship around following directions, first
absolutely, and then in relation to a waypoint that also moves.

## Day 11 Seating System
A nice little cellular automata. Seats on the ferry fill up or empty depending on 
(part 1) who is sitting next to you or (part 2) who you can see. Wrote a 
couple of versions of Life recently so nice and quick.

## Day 10 Adapter Array
Give a list of adapters, that can connect to certain other adapters, how many 
ways can I get through the adapters to the end. A really challenging one in that
a simple recursive solution worked fine for the small dataset, but the
big dataset had 97 adapters, which gave over 3 trillion solutions and 
recursion died. So I borrowed a Dynamic Programming / Memoisation idea from the
subreddit and it worked fine. The subreddit had many solutions, some of which
make no sense.

## Day 9 Encoding Error
Given a stream of numbers, find the first one that isn't the sum of a pair within the previous 25;
then the sum of some other numbers determined by that value. Straightforward.

## Day 8 Handheld Halting
Build a little 3 instruction processor, debug a program to find the infinite loop
and then figure out which instruction is wrong to allow it to terminate. Nice.

## Day 7 Handy Haversacks
Recursive objects, bags holding bags. Nice.

## Day 6 Custom Customs
Set manipulation. Disappointingly easy.

## Day 5 Binary Boarding
You're given a string of chars that identifies a specific seat on a
plan using binary space partitioning; decode each string e.g.
FBFBBFFRLR to work out which row and column you are in. Then from 
the list, find the missing entry.

## Day 4 Passport Processing
Parse a list of strings which have key-value pairs to make up
'passports' and find out with validation rules which are valid or not. e.g.

```'''  
ecl:gry pid:860033327 eyr:2020 hcl:#fffffd
byr:1937 iyr:2017 cid:147 hgt:183cm
```

## Day 3 Toboggan Trajectory
Definitely cute : a map of a hillside with trees, given a certain
angle to ride the toboggan down, how many trees do you hit ? The trees
repeat in patterns out to the right.

```
O.##.......
#.O.#...#..
.#..X.#..#.
..#.#.O.#.#
.#...##.O#.
```

## Day 2 Password Philosophy
Parse strings to find out which follow specified rules.

## Day 1 Report Repair
A list of 200 numbers, first part is to find a combination of 2 that adds up to 2020
and then multiply them together; second part was same thing but for 3 numbers.
